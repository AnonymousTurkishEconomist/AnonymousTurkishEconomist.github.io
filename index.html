                        Time to Write the Second Post
                    </h2>
                    Last week was a terrible week for Turkey. The currency depreciated a lot. Beside this, there is no intellectual discussion about a possible solution. 
                    The government claims that everything is under control and this was already a planned situation. They pretend that depreciation is done with the aim of 
                    creating an export heaven out of Turkey. What does the opposion economists say? Increase the interest rate! Reduce inflation! Increase the value of 
                    Turkish Lira! Then what? Nothing! They don't know what is going to happen once dollar becomes less than 10 liras again. They don't think about possible impacts
                    of further dollarization. In the intertemporal tradeoff, their objective function is today. Unfortunately. Instead of pushing the AKP economic discourse to a
                    conflict, they stick to what they memorized, e.g. central bank should increase the interest rate, inflation is miscalculated by TUIK, corrupt government made 
                    us poor. Okay. Thanks for informing us about things we already know. This is not what we need. Talk about the future. For example, let's say our currency is 
                    depreciated to make Turkey an export heaven. What are the steps that should be taken in accordance with this plan? Which ones of these are missing? What are 
                    current policies conflicting with the economic discourse of AKP? The simplest one: suppose we are going to be an export heaven. Today we will suffer and 
                    tommorow there will be a blue sky. So, what a rational person would expect is to keep the ownership of investments right? Otherwise, we will suffer today 
                    and somebody else will eat up the future stream of income generated by our suffering. Why do we decrease interest rates? We sacrifice today's easy money for 
                    future. Then why do we sell companies to UAE with celebration? What is the point of our suffering if we are going to sell the future income today for easy money?
                    This is not asked! Because opposition's economic ideology thinks in simple memorized terms. They think FDI is good. Yes, it may be good in some other context.
                    But is it really good and coherent with AKP's current economic discourse. Opposition economists still think AKP is lucky and managed to find money from somewhere. So,
                    they think he made something good. I don't think so...

                        Who am I...
                    </h2>
                    Who am I to write such a blog? Apparently not someone extrovert enough to reveal his identity. Not because I don't have courage or 
                        knowledge to defend myself, but because I hate discussing with stupid people and right now there is an increasing trend of such people.
                    Especially in twitter, a platform that has a lot potential to efficiently reveal and exchange infos, ideas, views; what I see is just repetition of 
                    same ideas. I don't know whether people use this retweet button because they are lazy to think or it has become a custom. There are a few guys who think
                    they are good economists because they studied economics (at various levels and institutions) and they can read some academic papers or foreign reports. 
                    They think they understand the mechanisms because they very well know how the macro-econ models developed for US works. When you criticize them in a polite
                    way, they behave as if they didn't get they are criticized. When you criticize them harder, they give you credit and thank as if they are already aware of
                    what they don't know and as if they are behaving in the way they do to make matters understandable by the general public. I know this is not the case...
                    
                    <p>I don't want to read or reply to the bullshit they talk about anymore. It is more beneficial to take notes in a clean environment. Therefore, I will write
                    this blog. </p>
