                        Who am I...
                    </h2>
                    Who am I to write such a blog? Apparently not someone extrovert enough to reveal his identity. Not because I don't have courage or 
                        knowledge to defend myself, but because I hate discussing with stupid people and right now there is an increasing trend of such people.
                    Especially in twitter, a platform that has a lot potential to efficiently reveal and exchange infos, ideas, views; what I see is just repetition of 
                    same ideas. I don't know whether people use this retweet button because they are lazy to think or it has become a custom. There are a few guys who think
                    they are good economists because they studied economics (at various levels and institutions) and they can read some academic papers or foreign reports. 
                    They think they understand the mechanisms because they very well know how the macro-econ models developed for US works. When you criticize them in a polite
                    way, they behave as if they didn't get they are criticized. When you criticize them harder, they give you credit and thank as if they are already aware of
                    what they don't know and as if they are behaving in the way they do to make matters understandable by the general public. I know this is not the case...
                    
                    <p>I don't want to read or reply to the bullshit they talk about anymore. It is more beneficial to take notes in a clean environment. Therefore, I will write
                    this blog. </p>
